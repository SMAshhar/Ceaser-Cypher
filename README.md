# Ceaser-Cypher
A simple ceaser cypher

How it works:

1. Files' definition:

  a) The input file (Info.txt) which contains the user's Date of Birth (DoB), ID, and name. Each in a separate line, example:
  123456
  9876543
  John Doe
  b) The plaintext file (plaintext.txt) which contain the message to be encrypted.
  c) The program carrying the code. (CC.py)
  
2. Upon running the code and choosing to encrypt, the program will create two files: Enc_key.txt (which contains the created key), and ciphertext.txt (which contains the encrypted message).

4. If decryption selected, it will decrypt the cyphertext.txt and creates Decrypted.txt (which contains the decrypted message).
